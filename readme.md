### CSS

*   Stop external CSS from messing with first meaningfull paint.
Right now the site is depending on CSS in order to be able to load the first view.
If you add critical CSS you can overcome this problem.

Critical CSS means you're adding only the nessecary CSS for the first view into your HTML (since HTML loads first).
This way the viewport is rendered like it's supossed to, but on the background the other CSS styles are being loaded.
