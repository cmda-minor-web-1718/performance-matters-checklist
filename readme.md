## Miscellaneous

*   Tip: Different profile / user in Chrome without extensions
*   Use the proper `lang`
*   Use a CDN

## Audits

*   The optimisation of the visual progress is terrible
    The website does not show any content till every content is loaded
    This problem leads up to a huge visual progress area

## HTTP optimisation

### HTTP/1

### HTTP/2

*   [Enable HTTP2](https://tools.keycdn.com/http2-test)

## Caching

*   Specify an expiration at least one week in the future for resources

## Minification

### Images

*   Compress images
*   Images with little detail and small colour pallet, are smaller with png format instead of jpg. If possible, use svg.

### CSS

*   Minify CSS

### HTML

*   Minify HTML

### JavaScript

*   Minify the JavaScript: either manually through
    [`jscompress`](https://jscompress.com/) or with something UglifyJS,
    potentially through Gulp

### Fonts

*   Add a fallback font
*   Use font subsetting

## Perceived Performance

*   Use a placeholder for background images (blurred/loading like) to
    indicate that here is and should be an image at that position

## Performance

### Images

*   Use newer image types (`.webp` or `.jxr`)
*   Use inline images for the hero image instead of a background image
*   Add `srcset`s and `sizes`
*   Use [`<picture>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture)s
*   Use (inline) `svg` when possible
*   Serve images in a proper size
    This will improve load time and save cellular data
    If you provide images larger than the user needs, you are just wasting bytes
*   Use client hints
*   SVG's are smaller but they do not render always faster than other formats. Especially when they are very complex. Render speed is also included with the load time of content.

### CSS

*   Add inline critical CSS
*   Remove unused CSS files
*   Reduce render-blocking stylesheets (such as with [`loadCSS`](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS))

### HTML

### JavaScript

*   Concatenate JavaScript files
*   Load JavaScript and CSS later so they don’t block rendering
*   Move script links in `<head>` to bottom of document
*   Add `defer` and `async` to all `<script>`s if they are not necessary to
    render above-the-fold content

### Fonts

*   Use something like `font-display: swap`

## Backend optimisation

*   If you’re using templates (such as in wordpress), make sure they don’t
    include things you aren’t using
