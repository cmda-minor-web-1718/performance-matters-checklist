## Audits

*   Add some more points here...
*   The optimalisation of the visual progress is terrible.
    The website does not show any content till every content is loaded.
    This problem leads up to a huge visaul progress area.

## HTTP optimisation

*   Add some more points here...

### HTTP/1

*   Add some more points here...
*   All files are being loaded by a HTTP1 request.
    This is not a big problem unless you are loading a lot of files separately.
    In the website there are a lot of css and js files being loaded.
    HTTP1 can only request a maximum of request at one time.
    This means this procces will take a lot longer.
