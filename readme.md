### HTTP/1

### HTTP/2

*  The current site is using http/1.1. If we change this to http/2 we can increase the speed. "HTTP/2 allows the server to "push" content, that is, to respond with data for more queries than the client requested. This allows the server to supply data it knows a web browser will need to render a web page, without waiting for the browser to examine the first response, and without the overhead of an additional request cycle" - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2)
