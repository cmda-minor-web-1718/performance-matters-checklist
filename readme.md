### HTTP/2

HTTP/2 is an new protocol that is introduced to increase the performance, specifically, end-user perceived latency, network and server resource usage. One major advantage is to allow the use of a single connection from browsers to a Web site.

You can check if you're using HTTP/2 by activating the developer tool and going to network tab. From there you can see which protocol the site is currently using.
